             Critic's Log: Earthdate - March 21, 2012. Review #2: Cowboy Bebop: The Movie
             <br/>
             <br/>
             It is the year 2071.  Halloween is in a few days and the Bebop crew is searching for bounty to find someone who is releasing a deadly virus. The original creators of the virus send a woman named Electra to find the man responsible for releasing this deadly virus. The fate of Mars rests on the Bebop crew.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             That is the gist of the Cowboy Bebop Movie.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             Cowboy Bebop: The Movie (also known in Japan as "Cowboy Bebop: Knockin' on Heaven's Door") was made by two animation studios,
             <span id="review87845" style="display: none;">
              those two being Sunrise and Bones, and boy does the collaboration pay off! The success of Cowboy Bebop led to a feature film that is just as good as the TV show. According to some sources, the events of the movie take place in between Sessions #22 and #23. I guess that makes sense, why would the movie take place after the show.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Beside all the technicalities of this movie, I'll explain what I liked and what I didn't like in the movie. First of all, I really like the animation. It looks better than the show and that is because the movie had a bigger budget than the show, but the animation is eye-candy from beginning to end.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              The Bebop crew is still the same old bounty hunters you know; there are two movie exclusive characters that are interesting in this movie in which the two are Electra and Vincent. There is a connection between these two, and I won't spoil the rest of it if you haven't seen the movie.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              I also appreciate the soundtrack for being a bit different than the show, Director Shinichiro Wantanabe chose an Arabesque atmosphere for the setting and some of the music because he felt it was alien to him and it was not used much in the show. The music by Yoko Kanno is still groovy
              <br/>
              <br/>
              As far as voice acting goes (from the U.S. Release’s language tracks), there are 3 versions, the original Japanese version (the subtitled version), the English dub, and the French dub. I am not going to comment on the French dub because I am going to make this clear, I am choosing to only comment on The subtitled version and The English dubbed versions of anime shows and films. Since I reside in the U.S., Animes that are released in the U.S. usually get subtitled versions and English dubbed versions. Some contain French dubbed versions but I chose not to comment on the French dubs. Moving on. The Japanese cast and The English dub Cast are both good on their own. Tsutomu Isobe was chosen to play Vincent and Ai Kobayashi were picked to voice Electra because neither of them had very much experience and they were both pretty good. As far as The English dub goes, Daran Norris' role as Vincent was scary good, and Jennifer Hale's role as Electra was good too. Both the subtitled and the dubbed versions are good. I already mentioned in my review of the TV show about that The subtitled version may be overshadowed by the English dub.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              If there is one thing I could complain is that the length of the movie may have been a bit too long in length, this could have been worked as a 2-part episode or even 3, but I guess it's nothing to complain about. Keiko Nobumoto's screenplay is good enough for this movie. It's still a good action flick that can be enjoyed with popcorn.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Cowboy Bebop: The Movie is available from Sony Pictures and Destination Films or whoever is behind distribution.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              With that said, The Cowboy Bebop movie is a really fun film; it has kick-ass action scenes and some amazing animation. It may not be necessary to watch with the show, but it is made for the viewers who liked the show. If you liked Cowboy Bebop, you'll probably like the movie too.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              I would give this movie a 10 out of 10 if it was really was connected to the show, but is it necessary to watch the film? Well, that is up to you. if I was rating this movie as a standalone movie, I would rate the movie somewhere along a 8 out of 10, But to be fair, since the show's episodes were treated like short films while The movie is obviously a feature-length film that is part of the Cowboy Bebop series (even though this movie was made after the TV show)  I'll give it a proper rating for the most part.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              I give Cowboy Bebop: The Movie a 9.5 out of 10...  it is EXCELLENT! It's not really a masterpiece compared to the show. But it's still awesome.
              <br/>
              <br/>

             This movie can be watched without watching the series but better if watched some episodes.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             Not surprised that a movie was created for Cowboy Bebop: a masterpiece series with unique and amazing atmosphere and soundtrack.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             The bulk of the story is about a terrorist that has the potential to kill a crowd of people with a weapon and has a huge bounty. It's up to Spike and his crew to get information and chase after the terrorist despite the enormous risk. Of course, other characters are also after the terrorist.
             <span id="review214579" style="display: none;">
              The plot sounds kind of mediocre doesn't it? Probably the weakest aspect of this movie. The Cowboy Bebop series have average plots but are at least episodic. A movie with an average plot would bound to fail but this isn't the case. Despite popular opinion, I enjoyed this movie more than the series.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              The art and animation were astonishing considering it was made in the 90s. Fluid animation and good lighting. The fighting scenes were quite memorable. The sound is amazing with jazz masterpieces like the series. You can see the impression of the 90s recession in Japan, despite set in a futuristic setting. This is why this movie and the series will always be a timeless classic. It's quite historic.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              What's memorable is that Jet, a crew member mentions to Spike that the crew does not have to go after the terrorist. It's not their problem. However, Spike wants the bounty but more importantly to save the world. They are heroes by choice. But what's more interesting is that after everything is over. No one recognizes and cares who stopped the terrorist. No one views them as heroes. They're just another bounty hunter as Spike likes to say. This adds to the amazing cowboy and loneliness atmosphere.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              The reason why I like the movie more than the series is because it feels like the characters are all working together despite saying they are not. In the series, you might see a few glimpses of some characters in each episode but not here. Also, there's improvement in the art. The best thing about this movie is how the characters interact with each other. Lot of the interactions are quite witty, sly and most of all cowboy like. The characters sound so cool. It really makes up for the mediocre plot.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              When Spike flew his jet into the sunset with a lot of tall buildings. I almost cried. It reminded me of the nostalgic times in the 90s. The 90s atmosphere is really strong in this one. What other anime or other shows makes you feel this way? Almost none. Even the sad animes and movies/shows outside anime didn't make me close to crying (other than Clannad).
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Definitely worth watching. A timeless classic similar to the series :)

            Cowboy Bebop: The Movie follows the Bebop universe and presents a new story of biological terrorism and bounty hunting. Spike, Jet, Faye, Edward, and Ein work together to catch a terrorist with a huge bounty on his head before he unleashes a deadly virus on Mars.
            <br>
             <br/>
             The Bebop movie is superb. If you are a fan of the series, you will not be disappointed, but you won't miss a beat if you decide to watch it without ever having seen the series either. Like the series, the movie features fantastic animation and a phenomenal soundtrack.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             If you haven't seen the series, enough cannot be said here about
             <span id="review17075" style="display: none;">
              the quality of animation and audio, and you should take a look at the review of the series itself. But what sets the movie apart (and above) is its story: while the plot isn't terribly intricate or even among the most interesting, it's still a plot. Viewers of the Bebop series will probably agree that for all of its pros, the show suffered at times from an incoherent plot and hit-or-miss episodes. Think of the Bebop movie as one long hit episode. The characters remain as lively and unique as they were in the anime, but here there is an enemy, a plan to capture him, teamwork, and a feeling of urgency and excitement. All of this culminates in a beautifully done final fight scene.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Apart from being slow at times, the Bebop movie has no negative aspects. It is a joy to see the landmark characters of the series in a full-length film. It is even greater to see a developed plot accompanying such fine music and animation. Fans and non-fans alike should give the Bebop movie a view.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Overall Score: A

            What happened?
            <br>
             <br/>
             This is the question I had asked myself after watching the superb Cowboy Bebop television series. It ended on a high, with a shootout that puts Spaghetti Westerns to shame and rode to one of my all time favourite anime with one of the most original premise in years.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             So why did this movie not succeed my expectations? The new setting was brilliant, unforced and wonderfully animated. The soundtrack as always is the wet dream of precocious and pretentious teenagers alike.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             Yet the story and characters were just flawed. I could forgive the somewhat muted interactions in the TV series because most of it
             <span id="review130813" style="display: none;">
              would come together at some point but nothing happened! Nothing pivotal and/or significant bar introducing a new villain who suffered from an inferiority complex compared to the more calm, collected and menacing, Vicious.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Spike literally adhered to everything we expect from a heavily noir-inspired protagonist and the rest of characters did not get enough screen time to develop profoundly in any shape. There was no new character arcs that I could connect with and nothing here for the audience to generally get pumped/or invested in.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Which is a shame, because outside of the predictable story and characters, the rest could have been condensed into another classic cowboy bebop episode. And that is what seems to have happened here, a setting was blown up with filler content, meretricious drama and more clocking for time as it finally decided Spike should have his confrontation with the villain.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              The mild disappointment is the disappointment that stings the most. A shame because I regard the TV shows to be a triumphant success in dragging people unaccustomed to the eccentricities of anime to fully appreciate the quirks in them. Better luck next time.

            This is one of the great anime movies. The only thing holding this movie back from "masterpiece" status is that the movie, which follows a pretty standard three-act structure, suffers from an over-reliance on (bad) tropes in the disaster/crisis stage. Without getting overly specific, some (but not all) of these tropes include "Untouchable Until Tagged"/"One-Hit Kill" and "Abduction Is Love"/"Damsel in Distress". The sad reality is that the rest of this movie is so freaking good that those tropes are even more noticeable, becoming more grating than they would have been in a worse movie. The animation and especially the sound direction are flawless, though.
            <span id="review365075" style="display: none;">
             In the end, this is one absolutely worth watching.

            Spoilers Ahead, btw:
            <br>
             <br>
              Truthfully, this movie is visually amazing. Great character designs, camera shots and very fluid animation. The story and characters on the other hand... well the movie is quite abysmal.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              The villain avoids death twice, the writers didn't know how to make him escape the situation they wrote for him to be in, so they simply didn't show how he did it, he fell to his death and then exploded with a grenade.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Spike gets shoot in the chest and somehow survives and after less than I week (I can only assume), fights the bad guy in the end. Also a small side note; while Spike
              <span id="review360651" style="display: none;">
               was looking around at the Eiffel tower, the bad guy could've shoot Spike from the shadows, instead he ran towards Spike and then shot him that way and missed his vital spot, again.
               <br/>
               <br/>
               Ed never told Jet where Faye was and that she was with the bad guy. For all Ed knew, she could've been dead and Ed did nothing to help, lol. Oh, and Jet doesn't do anything of note in the entire movie, all his scenes depict him as an incompetent idiot.
               <br/>
               <br/>
               The black guy who helps the bad guy was a one dimensional idiot, never got a sense of motive or reason he helped the bad guy.
               <br/>
               <br/>
               After the death of the black guy, Faye doesn't die because the bad guys motives are terrible, he saves her becuz he was horny (the only other reason you could find is that he mistakenly remembers her to be his lover, but that's stupid too, because he almost killed his actual lover in the train...). The villains motives are revealed by exposition and it feels hollow and stupid.
               <br/>
               <br/>
               I didn't understand how they found Spike in Arab town the second time he was there, but I could've missed what led to that part.
               <br/>
               <br/>
               The way Spike escaped the prison cell was laughably easy and incompetent from the part of the other bad guys. Also they are never shown to be punished by the end of the movie (seriously that part never gets resolved).
               <br/>
               <br/>
               The army shooting at Spike over the City (full of civilians) was stupid. The cure to the virus being thrown from planes was nonsensical, I've no idea how that would cure all the people exposed to the nanomachines. And I have no idea how there were no security guards to stop Faye from sending the rain to the parade. I also have no idea how she got away from that situation and why wasn't she arrested.
               <br/>
               <br/>
               If I rewatch the movie I'd probably find more nonsensical and stupid actions by the characters. But for now I am 100% satisfied by this terrible movie. 1 or 2 out of 10 for now.

            Cowboy Bebop: Knockin' on Heaven's Door does exactly what you would from a Cowboy Bebop movie. It’s got great music, interesting characters, well-choreographed action, great animation quality, and a whole lot of style. The Cowboy Bebop movie isn’t a sequel story, but rather a side story that is best treated as another episodic adventure of the Bebop crew. Note that this movie can be watched anywhere after watching Episode 9 of Cowboy Bebop and is best to watch it somewhere before you finish the series.
            <br>
             <br/>
             ~{Story}~
             <br/>
             Knockin’ on Heaven’s Door’s plot centers on a terrorist, who has a bounty of 300 million Woolongs, whose goal is
             <span id="review222746" style="display: none;">
              to exterminate everyone on Mars using a mysterious chemical disease. It’s up to the Bebop crew to save the planet (for a price!). From then on, the Bebop crew try to find clues that can lead them up to the terrorist. You’ve seen this premise many times; terrorism threatens the world, the good guys to the rescue. But because of Bebop’s stylish presentation, it feels fresh and fun. Though the story isn’t flawed (it’s actually quite well written) there’s just something about the story that just feels forgettable. Also the movie made me feel wanting more. We’re given background stories for some new character. Though they are interesting, it would have been better in they expanded on it even more. But in the end, the Cowboy Bebop movie has a fun and enjoyable storyline that is a welcome addition to the Bebop’s list of adventures.

              Story: 7/10

              <br/>
              ~{Presentation}~
              <br/>
              This is where the movie shines, because it is heavily like its original series. Cowboy Bebop is one of the most stylish anime out there, if not the most stylish, and the movie’s no differ. The movie balances many different genres, whether it be action, or sci-fi, or thriller. The jazz and pop music adds to the style of the show. Also the pacing of the movie is well done; it starts slow and by every second, the pacing is faster until the ending becomes a blast. The movie’s opening scene (the convenience store scene) doesn’t add much to the story, but the addition of it shows Bebop fans what they love about Bebop, and newcomers what Bebop is all about. The stylish presentation of the scene itself can make Tarantino blush!
              <br/>
              Presentation: 8/10
              <br/>
              <br/>
              ~{Character}~
              <br/>
              It’s fun to see the characters you love make a return in this movie. You have Spike, your unenthusiastic yet energetic protagonist back in the movie. Out of the four main characters him and Faye are the ones that get the most screen time, while Jet and Ed are kind of put in the back seat of the film (though Ed’s always in the back seat… or trunk). Two new characters are present in this movie. The one who plays the good girl is Electra, who manages to be badass enough to be likeable. Then we have the antagonist of the movie, Vincent, who manages to be a more developed character than the antagonist of the original series, Vicious. Vincent’s given a backstory and well enough reasons to justify his actions against society. However it would have been nice if we were given more of a deeper backstory on the two new characters. Nevertheless, the cast in the film shine heavily.
              <br/>
              Character: 7.5/10
              <br/>
              <br/>
              ~{Art}~
              <br/>
              The art in the Cowboy Bebop movie is top notch too. The movie depicts a future that’s not easy on the eyes, just like the anime series. Cowboy bebop did a great job depicting a futuristic environment that is more flawed than good, and the movie does no less. The detailed art can make anime today feel ashamed. The top-notch production value is what happens when you make Sunrise and Bones work together. However, I did notice that the use of colour in the movie seemed better than the anime series. As a matter of a fact is that the art is an improvement over the already excellent looking anime series.
              <br/>
              Art: 9.5/10
              <br/>
              <br/>
              ~{Animation}~
              <br/>
              The animations of this movie kept on making me check whether or not this was made in 2001. Just like the original series, most of the animation was hand-drawn, but it always felt too fluid to be hand-drawn. Scenes such as the Spike and Electra hand-to-hand combat scene or the end dogfight sequence, it makes you wonder how they accomplished that in 2001. The animation is a big reason why many prefer watching the movie after the series, since the animation difference is enormous. The cinematography is also a big improvement from the series. Since the movie uses a 16:9 ratio rather than the series’ 4:3 ratio, the cinematography feels more cinematic, such as the opening scene, where the combination of top view and wide shots make the movie feel more live-action than not.
              <br/>
              Animation: 10/10
              <br/>
              <br/>
              ~{Voice Acting}~
              <br/>
              The same cast for both Japanese and English is back, so you can expect top notch voice acting. Just like Cowboy Bebop, the Japanese voice acting is great, but the English voice acting is outstanding. Steven Blum still manages to add the coolness (and sexiness) in Spike. For the two new main characters in the movie, both Japanese and English voice actors do a great job. However it is to not that the English voice actor for Electra is Jennifer Hale (who won more accolades than you can imagine for Female Commander Sheppard in Mass Effect). Watch in in Japanese of English, you’re not missing out on a single thing.
              <br/>
              Voice Acting: 8.5/10
              <br/>
              <br/>
              ~{Music}~
              <br/>
              Though the same Cowboy Bebop soundtrack isn’t carried over to the movie, the new soundtracks end up being almost just as good. The opening song, “Ask DNA”, though isn’t a “Tank!”, it still manages to be catchy and it delivers a lot in style. The ending song “Gotta Knock a Little Harder” is excellent as it matches the mood of the ending of the movie. The movie has countless of soundtracks to remember, such as “Cosmic Date”, “Time to Know-Be Waltz”, “Clutch”, “Powder”, “What Planet is This?!”. “Clutch” and “What Planet is This?!” are some of the best tracks I’ve hears in any anime!
              <br/>
              Music: 9/10
              <br/>
              <br/>
              ~{Enjoyment}~
              <br/>
              It was more Bebop, how could I not enjoy it! The returning of the cast, the music, and the stylish execution was great. It could have been shorter; maybe some of those melodramatic scenes were there to bring up the runtime. But the movie’s still great fun as it manages to deliver what we want from a Bebop movie. With a blend of genres available, it never feels boring. The movie gives Bebop fans what they wanted, and newcomers an entrance to the main series. Although it doesn’t have as much replay value as the original series, Knockin’ on Heaven’s Door is a welcome addition.
              <br/>
              Enjoyment: 8/10
              <br/>
              <br/>
              In the end, Cowboy Bebop: Knockin’ on Heaven’s Door ends up being a great movie that captures the spirit of the original series. The structure of the movie makes the movie feel like it was made for both fans and newcomers. Combines with improved animations and a soundtrack that represents Bebop's spirit and you've got yourself one hell of a ride!

            A worthy addition to the unique setting of Cowboy Bebop -- Spike Spiegel with his Bruce Lee-like martial arts, a superb jazz soundtrack, stellar directing and writing, a Western feel that contrasts with so many other anime out there. If you've seen Cowboy Bebop, then I recommend viewing this before things get climactic towards the end and after the Bebop crew reaches five (including the dog).
            <br>
             <br/>
             Cowboy Bebop has this slow, almost melancholy pacing and a way of measuring out its photography that makes it feel like a live-action noir. There's no exaggeration here or overt dramatization of effects. It's as real as if it were
             <span id="review255013" style="display: none;">
              an actual snapshot of events in a futuristic universe. This is one of those rare gems in the library of anime that takes it seriously, that doesn't just pander to certain niche audiences. (I know that's also due to budget constraints, but still.) You don't have to even think about it -- watching Cowboy Bebop, you just know it's good. It's mature and thoughtful and reflects on the more grave facets of life.

            Plot: B *Note: it is described as being in between episodes 22 and 23 of the show, but I really don't think it matters when you watch it so long as you watch it prior to episode 24 spoiler: click to read. On Mars, a deadly virus has been unleashed on the people and the government has issued the largest bounty in history with a 300 million woolong reward for the capture of the mastermind behind it. Spike, Jet, Faye. Edward, and Ein much like in the TV series, form the unorthodox bounty hunter quintet that hopes to cash in on that bounty but ultimately
            <span id="review334675" style="display: none;">
             finds out that this case has far more implications than they could have possibly expected. Basically, if you come into this expecting another episode of Cowboy Bebop, you might be a bit disappointed. But if you are content with seeing a spy-action/sci-fi blockbuster in anime form with the Bebop squad saving the day in their same goofy style, then you'll enjoy this like I did.
             <br>
              <br/>
              Visuals: A: Improved from the show. The characters all look the same, but the main improvement is the lighting of the surroundings. And the film is all located on the planet Mars, so no cheesy hyperspace film stills nor wonky-looking satellites in this one. And the fight scenes are drawn really well.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Voice Acting: A+: They keep the same voices from the show, but the new characters included all have very good voices especially the antagonist Vincent Volaju. Edward is really funny in this too! And her ear-piercing Mariah Carey-like shrieks are kept to a minimum. Also, Lee Sampson's voice reminded me so much of Taika Waititi playing Korg in Thor: Ragnarok and I found it unintentionally hilarious.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Film Score/Soundtrack: B+ *Some great moments. It's more soundtrack heavy as opposed to score-heavy and there are ups and downs to that. The up is the fantastic opener, which I will highlight below. The lows are there a couple meh tracks that the movie gets montages too.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              ***Favorite Track: What Planet Is This?***
              <br/>
              (I think I could listen to this on a repetitive loop for all time and never grow tired of it.)
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Characters: B+: Same characters from the show and considering that it is based somewhere between episodes 22 and 23, their characteristics aren't expected to be very different and the writers did a good job in ensuring that the characters felt like we could plug them into another episode of Cowboy Bebop before or after this film. However, I will say that Elektra is a pretty forgetable addition. She was basically added to add a potential love interest and she didn't really add much to the film. But the antagonist Vincent was a really cool prescence and his fight with Spike at the end was epic!
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Cringeworthy Anime Moments: There were a few but it was once again the action movie cliches that were more bothersome to me. Both facility escape scenes were probably the worst examples of that. Also, who plans an execution the same day as an anticipated massive terrorist attack? That's James Bond villain levels of stupid.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Titles:
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Opening Titles: A+ *The song's called "Ask DNA" and it is awesome! Not as epic as Tank! of course, but it doesn't make the intro any less badass. The pre-credit scene and the way the characters walked during the opening was so Quentin Tarantino-like and I loved every moment of it.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Closing A+ *"Gotta Knock a Little Higher" is just one of those songs that is the right level of catchiness while still doing it's main job of making you feel like you just watched a movie and giving you that satisfied sense of closure.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Final Verdict: 8/10 *A great opening scene, better artwork than the show and an over-the-top but fun action film with some dorky and some cringey laughs. It doesn't get anywhere near as heavy as the show does, but since I'm a fan of James Bond, I am a-OK with the Cowboy Bebop movie essentially being a highly entertaining anime-Bond movie.a

            Cowboy Bebop: Knockin' on Heaven's Door is fantastic, both as a film and an addition to the already impressive anime series. If you liked Cowboy Bebop, you'll like Knockin' on Heaven's Door, but if you didn't, there isn't much here that will change your mind.
            <br>
             <br/>
             That said, most things that Cowboy Bebop did, the film does quite a bit better. The animation is particularly of note, being animated by the legendary Studio Bones instead of Sunrise, who were responsible for the TV show. Combine this with Shinichiro Watanabe's energetic direction and you have a film that keeps your eyes glued to the screen the entire time.
             <span id="review320174" style="display: none;">
              The action scenes especially are on par with Bones' own Sword of the Stranger and if you've watched that you'll know that's some high praise.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              The writing is about on par with a Cowboy Bebop episode, although it is of course longer and a little meatier to compensate for the greater runtime. While I certainly wouldn't call it bad, the story is far from Knockin' on Heaven's Door's strongest point. There's a fair bit of meandering and ultimately the conclusion didn't leave me feeling particularly satisfied. The credits start to roll more or less immediately after the climax, which I found to be somewhat disappointing. A few extra minutes just to tie everything together would have been appreciated.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              The main cast from the show are all here and they're all just as charismatic and likeable as they usually are. The new characters aren't particularly as strong, but I feel like this is more because of the somewhat weak story they play a part in than the characters themselves.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Those flaws aside, all of Cowboy Bebop's strengths from the show are present here. The soundtrack, composed once again by Yoko Kanno is just brilliant, and quite unlike what you'll hear in most other anime. The opening and ending tracks are certainly standouts, but the overall soundtrack is just as bombastic and catchy as you'd expect.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              To conclude, Cowboy Bebop: Knockin' on Heaven's Door is a great film and is certainly worth your time if you were a fan of the TV show. While the story is about on par with what you'd get from an episode of the anime (with all the good and bad that entails), the production values have been ramped up and Studio Bones' outstanding work with the animation really can't be understated. Check it out, space cowboys.

            One of my friends told me that this is his favorite Halloween film, and being a huge fan of the original series I felt like I had to see it. I’d recommend it as a seasonal watch and a more emotional side of Spike for sure. However the film doesn’t set out to solve anything new in the lives of the Bebop squad, but that doesn’t mean their plotting banter in front of screens of promising bounties finds gets stale. It’s very entertaining, beautifully animated, and keeps a pretty decent pace with its plotting. On top of that the film never gets dragged down thanks
            <span id="review311888" style="display: none;">
             to the established charm of the main cast. Cowboy Bebop the Movie is set between episodes 22 and 23 of the main show, nearing the grand finale. However, it doesn’t stand out much from the series despite the slick animation and par for the course fun action choreography.
             <br>
              <br/>
              Anyone who fell in love with the Bebop crew from the original show will enjoy seeing the main cast reluctantly work together again. The main five retain their charm and spunk as well as they did in the show, and their varied motives still moved the plot forward in unconventional ways. Ed establishes who they’re looking for, Jet asks his cop buddies for details, headstrong Faye goes off on her own, and Spike just goes with the flow but gets heavily involved by the end.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              I’m glad that they focused on Vincent’s multi faceted character instead of making him like some of the other one-off villains from the show. At times his story honestly felt reminiscent of V’s from V for Vendetta. The revolution against the Mars government that used him as a wartime experiment felt more compelling when the writing shed more light on his motives. However I would have been more compelled to find out what made him tick early on, because I got bored of watching an unexplainably powerful and creepy character overpower Spike and get rapey towards Faye for 45 minutes. I liked that his motives played into the Knockin’ on heaven’s door subtitle for the movie, and I think he stands out like the lady in the first episode, Gren, and the brain scratch cultists. I wanted to like Elektra more as a supporting character but she felt like a watered down version of Kei from the movie iteration of Akira. She wrung some very tender introspection out of Spike, but mostly just acted as the government presence chasing Vincent.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              I’d say definitely watch this as a much longer episode of Bebop. Other than the butterfly resurfacing in the show, the movie doesn’t add much to the overall story of the show. I enjoyed it as I would any other episode of the show, as it featured a great blend of jazzy action scenes and introspective moments regarding Spike’s regret filled past. The writers used Elektra as a character to wring these tender moments from our favorite bounty hunter, although I was a little sad that she didn’t stand strongly as her own character. I can definitely recommend this movie to either established fans of Cowboy Bebop and even newcomers, although some fans of the show may be either disappointed or delighted that the movie is more of the same instead of a solid stand alone project.

            Cowboy Bebop, the Movie - ''Knockin' at Heaven's Door'' (2001)
            <br>
             <br/>
             Review:
             <br/>
             <br/>
             The anime feature film was sponsored by the well-known, world famous ‘Tristar’ entertainment in association with the ‘Sunrise’ pictures. This animated anime feature film is or was a production of the famous ‘Bones’ studio, the one and only studio to be responsible for the one and only “Wolf’s Rain”; and was aired in the year 2001. The executive producer of this particular movie is Takayuki Yoshii (from the Sunrise pictures) with Ryohei Tsunoda (from the Bandai visuals: responsible for Jin Roh~The Wolf Brigade, 1999)
             <br/>
             Mechanical design: Kimitoshi Yamane
             <br/>
             Set design: Shihi Takeuchi
             <br/>
             On IMDB, the movie holds a rating
             <span id="review225964" style="display: none;">
              of 7.9/10 with 4 stars out of 5. The BBC too, awarded it 4/5 stars, calling it ‘an example of anime at its very best’ and ‘good enough to deserve mention in the same breath as Akira, Ghost in the Shell and Spirited Away.’ It was also nominated for the Online Film Critics Society Awards in the best animated feature category (2004)
              <br/>
              - Taken from both Wikipedia and My Personal Analysis as Well
              <br/>
              Plot: 7/10 (for being too ordinary, it should be rated 6/10, but the suspense that revolves around Vincent and his link to a few particular characters, it get not more than 7/10 at least from my side.)
              <br/>
              The plot rests on the bounty hunter named Spike Spiegel and his crewmates aboard the vessel named Bebop in their efforts to find a criminal who is planning to release an unknown pathogen on Mars. The title of the movie is taken from Bob Dylan’s song, which goes by the identical name. The main antagonist, i.e., the character Vincent is based on the musician (such an awesome creative mind, gotta say.)
              <br/>
              The movie includes the characters who belong to the anime series of the name ‘Cowboy Bebop’, as the name suggests, but out of the entire batch of the anime team, only a few prominent members are portrayed here in the movie with the bounty hunter named Spike Speigel, being the main protagonist (as always); supported by Faye Valentine, Jet, Edward and their pet dog Ein.
              <br/>
              The events or the plot rest in an era in the year 2071, a few days just before October 31st, i.e., the Halloween. An unknown pathogen is being released in the capital city of Mars, and the government has issued a bounty of around 300 million woolong (wish I could enjoy that provision xD)
              <br/>
              Spike and his crew take upon the case with the hopes of earning a heavenly kind of bounty like that. But the mystery surrounding the antagonist, responsible for the breakout of the pathogen lies hidden until Spike meets a beautiful (and a seductive) maiden named Elektra, who is an agent serving for the very organization which was responsible for the creation of the virus pathogen. She was sent by her organization to hunt down Vincent Volaju, who was made a target of the Bebop crew a long time back, in order to earn the heavy bounty hanging over his head.
              <br/>
              As the hunt for this man called Volaju, with no past and no possible future escalates, the fate of the entire human race rests in the hands of the Bebop crew, who themselves aren’t sure of their capability to handle and perform their responsibilities efficiently.

              The original soundtrack was written and performed by the Seatbelts who released an album and a mini album of the film’s music entitled Future Blues and Ask DNA respectively.

              Character design and animation director: Toshihiro Kawamoto- 9.5/10
              <br/>
              As we all know the characters of this anime and their respective characteristics, abilities and attitudes, I don’t think I should mention anything else about them anymore. But as far as the additional characters are concerned, they deserve a bit of highlight. Rashid, an Arabian is portrayed in the movie as Spike’s nemesis, with a ridiculously funny yet mysterious personality. He seems to know everything about Spike’s intentions and objectives to hunt Vincent down. He appears out of nowhere, with an identity of an informant and guides Spike till the root of the matter, where even the government organization couldn’t make its approach. Then there is this antagonist: Vincent Volaju. I have no comments regarding this mysterious guy because there are no words to describe his personality and attitude. I can just give an idea regarding that, using the term ‘Perfect Anti-Heroic Character’ besides some other well-known characters within your knowledge. Elektra, yeah, she’s kind of a beautiful young lady, who has a direct link with Vincent, as they were once the partners in the same task-force, rather lovers. You’ll know when you watch the movie. So do it, at once.

              Opening: 10/10
              <br/>
              The stunts and the badassness along with the comedy deserve it. Before that, there was a short glimpse of Vincent, playing with the glass marble containing the virus, with the narrating these lines:
              <br/>
              “He was always alone, always by himself. Never anyone to share the game. He lived in another world. He was that kind of guy.”
              <br/>
              So, these lines are perfect assets, to describe the personality of Vincent I guess.

              Ending: 10/10
              <br/>
              The entry of various pilots in the perfect time, in order to spray the antidote to nullify the effect of the pathogen, just when the Halloween began. It was just awesome. Apart from this, the fight scene between Spike and Vincent deserves hats off. Plus, the emotion filled climax, when Elektra shoots down Vincent, in order to save Vincent’s life. Ah! No more comments. The ending lines were:
              <br/>
              “Shall we go together?” (Elektra and Vincent, both pointing their pistols at each other) *bang*
              <br/>
              Elektra opens her eyes in astonishment, as she herself couldn’t believe what happened back then. Vincent was found lying almost dead, just before Spike, with his chest pierced apart from the bullet which ran through Elektra’ pistol. Spike said, struggling, “Vincent! Why didn’t you shoot?”
              <br/>
              “I remembered… she was the one I loved. I wanted to escape from here. I searched for the door out of this world. But now I understand. There is no door.”
              <br/>
              “You should’ve known! You were frightened to open your eyes and see.” says Elektra.
              <br/>
              “Elektra… the time I spent together with you… was my only reality. I’m so glad we could meet again at the end.” Saying these lines, Vincent closes his eyes… forever…
              <br/>
              This particular scene from the movie is really emotional…

              Overall Rating: 8.62/10
              <br/>
              If the plot would be a bit more extra-ordinary or uncanny, like that of Wolf’s Rain; Trinity Blood; Berserk; Hellsing, etc. I would gladly give it a rating of 15/10 from my side. It’s just the script, stunts, artwork, animation, prologue and the epilogue, which made me, give it 8.62/10; or else I would drag it down to 2/10.
              <br/>
              I haven’t included an additional paragraph for ‘Script’ as I mentioned enough in the last two sections of ‘Opening’ and ’Ending’. I guess it’ll be okay.
              <br/>

              Some additional Statutory Warning(s):
              <br/>
              As we all know Faye Valentine to be one of the most attractive and seductive characters from the anime series, I want to warn the n=minors towards a few scenes related to her. Her clothing and appearances, being number one, and the particular scene when she was about to become a victim of a rape case after being abducted by Vincent, who forcefully kissed her and unbuttoned her jacket, with his knife. Unfortunately she was spared by him, as he was more inclined to the spreading the pathogen than raping a helpless maiden xD. But still, only due to that particular scene, it requires a rating of U/A and PG. That’s all for today… Enjoy your day everybody…

            Story:
            <br>
             <br/>
             First of all, the story raised some questions and I couldn't follow it. Something about people getting sick from nanomachines? The story didn't seem to do the TV series justice. It takes place around Halloween and the characters are off to try and defeat Vincent and there's a tower that looks like an Eiffel Tower. The Halloween plot just seems to be unnecessarily added in there just to make Vincent look freaky than he already is.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             Characters:
             <br/>
             <br/>
             It was nice to see the characters especially Spike again, but I always felt that this movie was was disappointing compared to the series. I felt that something was wrong
             <span id="review238579" style="display: none;">
              with the characters like Spike. He just seemed quite persuasive. Vincent is a terrible villain. He's just a Spike copycat for Spike to try and relate to and also defeat.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              I didn't really think much of Faye and Jet, but Faye in here was annoying with her talkativeness about going out on the race track or something.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Electra minus her know-it-all personality seemed like she could be a good character but the end ruined it for her. If Vincent was the guy who wanted to terrorize other people, why was she still in love with him? She's beautiful but this whole love story at the end was contrived.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Animation:
              <br/>
              <br/>
              The Cowboy Bebop animation looks more exciting and surreal than the series. There is some fast camera movements. Though, Spike's clothes look darker than in the TV series. But the problem is that one minor character kept moving his arms around when he was frightened and he was talking to Vincent before he shot him.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Voice acting and music:
              <br/>
              <br/>
              The English dub was probably the best part of the movie. I liked how well Steven's voice captures Spike's interest for Electra, and like the series, the other voice actors did well capturing the characters' personalities. Though, I don't know about Vincent, I think he still needs to shut up. The music captured the emotions well. Though, the music isn't jazzy, disappointingly, but oh well, it sounds more country-like and the music sounds catchy. I don't like country music but the country music here sounds pretty catchy.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Overall
              <br/>
              <br/>
              It's pretty good for a Cowboy Bebop movie. It has pretty high re- watch value because I loved some of the characters but I still thought the series was more interesting.

            This is a cult movie of the great series cowboy bepop
            <br>
             the story has a lack of action but all the other elements make the movie a real outstanding film that its a must if you like the series I highly recomend you watch the series first but if you watch the movie first it will be alright
             <br/>
             because it is not connected with the trama in the series.
             <br/>
             the music its an amazing composition of yoko that makes your ears fly to the blue sky, see you cowboys.

            Most anime movies fall into 2 categories. Some act like big series finales that are essential to the story of their respective anime. Others, act more like bigger, funnier, or more action filled adventures that are not needed to complete the story.
            <br>
             <br/>
             This movie is more like the second type. While not necessary viewing for fans of the series, I could not recommend it any higher. Despite being more than fifteen years old, the animation is a marvel to behold. Just like the series, all the animation is done by studio BONES and thus has some of the best choreography and best looking action around. If
             <span id="review252890" style="display: none;">
              you enjoyed the series, you will love this. If you haven't seen the series and want to, this would actually be a good place to start. The film captures all of the fun, action, emotion, great writing, and amazing soundtrack that people love about the series.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Side note, much like the series the Dub is an absolute must. Even the origianl Japanese cast and the creator of the show and film admit that the English cast is better.

            A great sense of flow and great music. The voice actors are breath taking in both Japanese and English. It does run a bit long, but its still entertaining.

            With a show like "Cowboy Bebop" and it's episodic format (meaning status quo is returned to at the end of most episodes) it's only natural that a movie would come out of that franchise. I expected at least 2 or 3, but only got 1. But boy did they ever make it count! "Cowboy Bebop: Knockin' on Heaven's Door" is everything a fan of the show would want and/or expect from a feature length film. Perhaps even a bit more.
            <br>
             <br>
              Our story pits the crew of the Bebop against arguably their greatest foe: a terrorist with a weapon that could wipe out billions. The man in
              <span id="review222506" style="display: none;">
               question is a new character, Vincent Volaju, who has the way, the will, and a good axe to grind in his motives for committing genocide. He is menacing, intimidating, interesting, and even sympathetic at times. Also in the pursuit of Vincent is another new character, Elektra Ovirowa, who adds another element of competent, bad-ass sex appeal to this cast which is typically a one woman show. I honestly wish this character was a semi-regular on the show. She has a lot of potential, like so many one and done characters in this series.
               <br/>
               <br/>
               The art is of equal and better quality than the regular series. With some really great fight scenes, beautiful settings and backgrounds, and with all the stuff going on you need to hit the pause button to take it all in. The soundtrack is that rapid-jazz that keeps up with action like on the regular show, with some more dramatic pieces for the villain, and is as toe-tapping as anything else on the main show. The Sub vs. Dub battle is still in favor of the English dub, with the same cast as the series returning and playing their parts to perfection.
               <br/>
               <br/>
               The way I know this is a great movie is that I can show it to someone who is not a fan of the show or even a fan of Anime and they will probably enjoy it. It's very kind to the uninitiated, and for those of us who are initiated it's everything we love about this franchise and more. It's a great time and a real blast. 8/10. Check it out. Cheers!

            The movie is a more like an extended episode, but whatever. The plot is kind of generic, bad guy threatens the world, but it's done fairly well.  The main villain, Vincent, does a decent job of coming across as bad guy. He's more the quietly insane kind of guy. There's little to none character development, but that's not so bad with the main cast. Unfortunately, we don't learn that much about Vincent or Electra, an agent of a pharmaceutical company, who has some connection with Vincent. There were clearly some lost opportunities to develop their characters more; we don't care so much about them
            <span id="review107669" style="display: none;">
             since there's not much to care about. It's a shame, because she and Vincent had quite the past to expound on. There are some cool fight scenes, the best of which is the one between Spike and Electra, the animation is pretty fluid, and they did a great job of showing that while Spike is still boss, Electra is still awesome in a fight :). There's a dogfight scene which has really fluid animation, a really great job.
             <br>
              <br/>
              There were some plot holes though that niggled at me, but nothing particularly bad. This movie takes place during the series, so watch it then. It's pretty good, so don't turn it down!

            At this point, I am just a sucker for anything Cowboy Bebop.
            <br>
             <br/>
             Honestly, I have always been skeptical of anime movies that come out of a ongoing series (eg. the likes of Naruto movies). My experience with them had been this: since the movies are not allowed to add anything to the storyline, they all have a similar plot structure, sequence, and a general lack of urgency.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             However, Cowboy Bebop doesn’t really have an ‘ongoing storyline’ (while there is an overarching plot to the show, the anime does not revolve around that storyline). That’s why - for the most part - each episode of CB
             <span id="review281851" style="display: none;">
              retains its individuality.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              If I had to give an analogy, most anime series are like a knocking down a set of dominos: one leads to the other to create a linear storyline with a start and a finish. On the other hand, CB is like cooking a meal: there is generally an accepted way of preparing the meal, but you can add/subtract ingredients to enhance the dish and play around with the order. Ultimately, you’ll get the same dish with different depths of flavor. In that sense, the Cowboy Bebop movie is one such ingredient.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              It’s really captivating and artful. It does not necessarily add to the overarching story, but it definitely enhances it - just like any other episode. The plot is dynamic, the music is catalyzing, the art is vivid, and … well … the characters are as good as usual.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              I read in another review that the movie should be watched alongside the middle of the series. That person’s advice definitely isn’t wrong, but I wouldn’t say it’s not quite right either. Why? Once again, Cowboy Bebop has an affinity to it that isn’t linear. So, any real fan of the show can watch a movie like this whenever and really appreciate the beauty of it.

            Cowboy Bebop: The Movie/Cowboy bebop: Tengoku no Tobira is a film by Shinichirō Watanabe, and a great reference to highlight the faults of television film adaptations.
            <br>
             <br/>
             Cowboy Bebop: The Movie falls into the common pitfall of feature film television adaptations. It essentially takes what could have been a 24 minute episode of the original show, and stretches it into a 2 hour film. This results in severe pacing issues and an excessive amount of narrative padding. This alone would be enough to severely weaken a film, but Cowboy Bebop: The Movie's problems stretch beyond that. Pretentious, pseudo-philosophical dialogue and a terribly weak supporting cast result in
             <span id="review248504" style="display: none;">
              a film with a frankly crippled story that would've been better left untold.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              The plot itself is fairly solid on paper. It's fairly cohesive and easy to follow. The first act starts off well, with the main cast going through the motions and setting the tone of the film to mirror that of the TV show.  However by the second act, it becomes very obvious that it wasn't written with 2 hours of storytelling in mind, and this is the fundamental reason why the film doesn't work. In order to fill the two hour run-time, the second act is padded with unnecessary scenes of exposition. Worse still is that much of the same information is reiterated over and over multiple times. When you aren't watching Jet get spoon-fed information, you're watching Spike get spoon-fed the same information instead. This results in a very dull 2nd act, which unfortunately has repercussions on the third act. The action ramps up suddenly and the tone has several odd shifts.  You're juggling an intense dogfight between space ships and a comedic sequence involving old fashioned aircraft, followed by a sombre gun-fu fight to finish the film. All of which comes out of nowhere and, thanks to the poor pacing, fails to engage the discerning audience member.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              The art is, as you would expect from a high budget animated film, excellent. I read that the Director attempted to employ live-action Cinema camera techniques into the film, and you can tell. The shot composition is excellent, particularly in the fight sequences. It's almost like watching a Bruce Lee film at times. The art style of the show is perfectly replicated and the shift to the  cinematic 1.85:1 aspect ratio instead of the series' 4:3 means there's a lot more picture for the audience to enjoy this time around. The celluloid shots ooze with detail not often seen in today's digital animation. Certainly a great improvement to the show's already excellent visuals.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              <br/>
              The sound design is decent although I noticed a slight drop in quality in the English dub of my Blu-Ray copy compared to the original TV series, particularly noticeable in Jet's (Beau Billingslea) lines. The music, produced by series composer Yoko Kanno, is of a high standard, although there's a notable lack of Big Band or Bebop tracks this time. The film's best track "What Planet is This?", being the sole exception. Performed by The Seatbelts, the same outrageously skilled band that recorded many of the show's best tracks, and it ranks among the best pieces of music the franchise has to offer. It's a real shame that this track is the only one that bears semblance to the classic Bebop sound that defined the show. The other tracks are relatively forgettable, and none of them wow me the way that the show's Tank, Rush, Space Lion, Road to the West and even Ave Maria did.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              The characters are unfortunately one of the show's weakest elements. As stated before, the film runs for 2 hours, and a lot of the responsibility for keeping things entertaining falls to the primary cast, who return from the TV series. Spike, Jet, Faye, Ed and Ein are present and are just as they were during the early third act of the show.  Unfortunately, they lack some the charisma and energy they possessed in the show. I suppose it's to be expected. No cast, regardless of how strong, can hold a film up on its own. Things only get worse when you look at the film's original characters. Most of them are bland archetypes and not worth the time it would take to discuss them. Only one is important to the plot; Elektra. Elektra is a secondary protagonist, initially introduced as a obstacle in the way of our heroes. She ends up fighting alongside them by the end of the show and she plays an important part in deciphering the nature of the film's villain, a menacing terrorist known only as Vincent.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Vincent is a complicated character to talk about, but certainly not for the reasons Watanabe likely intended. He's frankly a bit of a mess. His dialogue is baffling. He speaks in lofty pseudo-philosophical prose. This would be bad enough, but many of his lines are also written rather inelegantly. At one point he compares the notion of dying to "dreaming in silence". I can't help but wonder if it's the result of a bad translation from the original Japanese. It sticks out a lot, especially when compared to the TV show's excellently localized script.  Another odd choice is his character design. He bears an extremely strong facial resemblance to protagonist Spike Spiegel. So much so that I initially assumed it would be a major plot point. Think about it. This is the Cowboy Bebop movie! Of course there was going to be a great villain! What better opponent could there be for Spike to face than a member of his own family? Or even a clone? The possibilities are endless! Overall, Vincent is a very underwhelming villain. He doesn't compare to the TV show's Vicious, who while also being rather 2 dimensional, had an elegant menace to him that made him a joy to watch.  He was a perfect mirror to Spike's unkempt charm.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Overall, the film is a passable watch the first time through, but it holds very little rewatch value and the enjoyment factor fades before the halfway mark on repeat viewings. As a fan, all the film really managed to do was make me sad and bitter that we hadn't gotten a better film. It's not bad enough that I actively dislike it, but it doesn't entertain me anywhere near as much as the show does. On it's own it's a decent enough film, but it pales so much in comparison to the show that I can't encourage any series veterans to seek it out.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              If you're looking for a good action flick, you'll do better looking elsewhere.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              If you're looking for a good Cowboy Bebop experience, you're better off rewatching the series, and saving yourself the disappointment of seeing how this franchise went out.
